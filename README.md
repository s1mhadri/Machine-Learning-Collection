## 1. k-Nearest Neighbors
* Implementing the kNN algorithm with uniform and distance-based weighting and arbitrary k.
* The parameter weights will either contain the string uniform or distance.
    * If the value is uniform, the classifier should use the Euclidean distance for determining nearest neighbors and uniform weighting.
    * If the value is a distance, the classifier should use the Euclidean distance for determining neares neighbors and perform distance-weighted classification.
* Implement functions to compute precision, recall and F1-score.
